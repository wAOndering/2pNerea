# 2pNerea
Script for analysis of 2p data. Slight variation of data extraction between 2pNerea and 2p rescue.
_functionality and usage of the script need to be further developped along with documentation_

#### Data extraction and export
This is for simple data extraction for 2 photon analysis

#### Data extraction and export (advanced) 
This was generated to enable data extraction and operation with the neuropil. Need to update the functionality and potentially merge with the simple data extraction script.

#### Generating ROI
[segmentation section]()
This script enable the generation of subset of ROI outside of pre-determined area. Thus it is possible to look at area outside the cells and within other structure it can be modified to determine structure identity and size.

#### Script to perform batch analysis
Add the level up matfile scripts that enable to batch the analysis with fluoroSNNAP
